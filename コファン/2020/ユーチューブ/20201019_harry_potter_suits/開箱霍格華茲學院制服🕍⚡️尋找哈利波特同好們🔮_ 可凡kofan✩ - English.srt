00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:22,420
Hello everyone！

2
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,110
I'm KoFan！who is cute and innocent

3
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,930
Beautiful temperament, elegant, energetic, cheerful, young and talented

4
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,640
Have a pretty child-like face but a charming full-grown and figure kind-hearted ！

5
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,720
Everyone knows I like Harry Potter so much

6
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,910
That should be called Meow House Shop

7
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:40,020
He has co-branded with Harry Potter to produce a series of uniforms

8
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,060
Although I think it's uniform is not an orthodox uniform

9
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,580
His shirt is a bit like made of cotton

10
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,380
And the skirt is not very orthodox

11
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,790
But I still think it's pretty cute

12
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,030
Then there happened to be another one in Taiwan

13
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,250
A Photo studio of Magician's Chamber

14
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,390
I think it's super cute

15
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,820
I made a special appointment for a day and went to take a photograph

16
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,930
You can appreciate the photos later

17
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,600
Um…

18
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,830
Actually this is my first time

19
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,860
To take a photograph so seriously

20
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,190
Because I really like harry potter

21
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,230
Also I like this series of clothes

22
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,490
And a series about magic

23
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,020
I'm really worried that I can't shoot well

24
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,820
I hope after everyone appreciate

25
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,610
You acn give me some criticism and advice of the photos

26
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,970
Before the video starts

27
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,770
I want to tell everyone

28
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,200
Because it's material is made by cotton

29
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,010
And

30
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,880
Although I have iron and clean up cat hair
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,200
Because I have three cats

31
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,250
It still has some wrinkled feeling or

32
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,370
Not good enough

33
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,640
Please forgive me and hope everyone can be considerate

34
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,730
I'm sorry about that

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,890
At the beginning

36
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,050
First of all we have to say

37
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,820
Everyone can take a look at my costume

38
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,090
I'm from HufflePuff College

39
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,040
At the beginning

40
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,280
Because of the movie

41
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,880
Although everyone should be

42
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,430
Gryffindor or Slytherin are more

43
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,860
At first I thought I should be Gryffindor

44
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,750
because

45
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,610
When I was young I felt that Gryffindor was the best

46
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,930
And Slytherin is the worst

47
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,770
But in the end I felt that I should be

48
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,650
Hufflepuff

49
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:08,920
Because I am not as smart as Ravenclaw

50
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,060
Nor as courageous as Gryffindor

51
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,460
Nor as ambitious as Slytherin

52
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,250
So

53
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,280
I think at least my only strength is kindness

54
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,920
Can I say that?

55
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,010
I don’t think people can be 100% of kind

56
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,450
But I think I should be regarded as a kind-hearted

57
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,780
Witch

58
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,610
Let's take a look at the first set

59
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,160
HufflePuff
61
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,730 is
The first set of HufflePuff’s signature yellow

60
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,460
I bought this cloak at Universal

61
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,230
I feel it is

62
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,300
Cute

63
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,500
All right

64
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,050
Everyone can look at the bow tie

65
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,600
It's a complete set

66
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,510
And there is this school badge on the chest

67
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,680
There is also a copper badge inside the skirt

68
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,580
And behind it is Hefpaff’s

69
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,840
Sailor collar

70
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:17,120
This one is blue

71
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,440
Then I think it feels like college

72
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,400
Then because it's Ravenclaw

73
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:23,740
and so

74
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,380
I make him feel very smart

75
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,140
The feeling of holding a pile of books

76
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,050
I don’t think they made the bow

77
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,500
Very orthodox

78
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,630
But I really like this place around his waist

79
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,230
Everyone can see

80
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:51,400
Each piece has a different color in each college

81
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,480
do you know?

82
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,990
When the sorting cap was divided into wonderful beauty

83
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,010
It is hesitating to say whether to assign Hermione Jean Granger to Ravenclaw

84
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,950
Because she is so smart

85
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,830
It should be said that it is just a personality trait

86
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,890
Maybe there is a person who actually has 4 talents

87
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:19,750
4 ability

88
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,130
Maybe he has it

89
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,460
Finally

90
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,410
It’s a very popular Gryffindor

91
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,640
I tied a ponytail

92
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,290
Looks more vitality

93
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,620
Be vigorous

94
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,000
Then please ignore the hem of my dress

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,990
I seem to forget to make it swing

96
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,100
And I don’t know where did I put the bow tie

97
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,930
So I matched a tie by myself

98
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,320
But I think it shouldn’t be matched look so bad

99
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,310
Then this scene

100
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,030
I'm learning from Hermione Jean Granger

101
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:03,830
The scene when she was making the transformation potion before

102
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,040
Although my appearance is not as good as
Hermione Jean Granger

103
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,010
but

104
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,210
when I'm imitate my idol

105
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,600
I still feel pretty happy

106
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:18,420
Antlers, I wanted to test everyone, which character is called Antlers？

107
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,360
At last

108
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,060
I want to apologize to everyone

109
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,450
Just embarrassed

110
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,600
I don't have Slytherin uniform

111
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:44,100
Because I said I need to be see things in black and white

112
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,110
The two attitudes stand in sharp contrast

113
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,090
This is my personality

114
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,680
but

115
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,870
When I read the novel a few times after I grow up

116
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,500
Although when I was a child

117
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,290
This is another story

118
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:00,640
Anyway, when I was young, my family was very strict

119
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,300
Have no computer have no mobile phone

120
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,520
Have no TV or something of technology

121
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,710
So I just read Harry Potter novels all day

122
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:12,180
Then from episode 1 to that time, how many episodes did it appear? episode 5 ?

123
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,870
Then read from episode 1 to episode 5

124
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,480
Then after reading it

125
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,040
, I will look back from the first episode to episode5 , This is a cycle

126
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,710
Then I would take a flashlight and read Harry Potter inside the bed

127
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,200
Then I felt I just like Harry Potter

128
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,910
hide inside the bedand read the magic book when he during holidays

129
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,480
The same feeling of that

130
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,230
No! I want to apologize to everyone

131
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,450
I don’t have clothes of Slytherin

132
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,430
But after when I growing up

133
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:43,030
We don ' t live in a world of black and white morality

134
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,010
It's just like

135
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,540
Severus Snape is

136
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,840
Slytherin's

137
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,810
But you think he is a bad guy？

138
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,200
He really is a bad guy？ Does he ？

139
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,300
He is really harmful？Does he？

140
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,560
Did he really kill? Does he？ I think

141
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,300
actually he just

142
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,170
actually he just

143
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,760
Wants to blend in with everyone

144
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,960
He doesn't have his

145
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,730
Own social circle

146
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,320
So

147
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,670
He will

148
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,240
Want to take refuge

149
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,610
The power of Lord Voldemort

150
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,680
Because he wants to make himself stronger

151
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,860
But I think he is essentially good

152
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,850
And the people in Graffindor are really good? Does them ？

153
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,460
In fact, you see that Luna Lovegood have bullying of other students andLuna Lovegood’s
things will be hidden

154
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,130
And even

155
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,600
Harry Potter's Dad James Potter

156
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:35,410
At that time, although both parties James Potter andSeverus Snape were fighting and play
tricks on themselves

157
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,510
But this is also an active of bullying

158
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,080
So I feel

159
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:48,680
Is really like this? So in the end I discovered that the four colleges have their own advantage and disadvantage

160
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,100
It's doesn't

161
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,300
Only the dark wizard is assigned to Slytherin

162
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,610
And because I really took this recently

163
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,950
Then I felt that one Slytherin uniform was missing

164
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,790
I think it's a pity

165
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,510
So

166
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,830
I just search internet about Slytherin unifors

167
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:09,620
Before I searched, the meow shop

168
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,250
It sold the series of co-branded with Harry Potter again

169
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:11,630
So

170
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,120
I bought Slytherin's immediately

171
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,460
But it may not be seen in this video

172
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,490
I'm really sorry about that

173
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:22,370
I hope this video can

174
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:23,990
???

175
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,640
Can make you happy when you watch this video

176
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,620
I really like Harry Potter very much

177
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,130
If anyone also likes Harry Potter

178
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,740
Wizards！

179
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,350
Want to see me share more about that

180
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,980
I've been to Universal Studios in Japan before

181
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,370
Then I went to New York to see that

182
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,780
The Musical of the Cursed Child

183
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,190
Then I bought some accessories

184
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,720
If you want to see

185
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,590
