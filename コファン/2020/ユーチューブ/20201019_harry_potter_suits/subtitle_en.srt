00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:22,420
Hello everyone！

2
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,110
I'm KoFan with cuteness , innocence,

3
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,930
beauty , elegance , vigor, cheerness, youth and talent ,

4
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,640
with angel face, devil body, and kindness.

5
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00 :30,720
Everyone knows I like Harry Potter so much

6
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,910
That Here we call the Meow House Shop,maybe.

7
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:40,020
There are a lot of series of co-branded uniforms with Harry Potter.

8
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,060
Although I think its uniform is not an orthodox uniform

9
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,580
Its shirt is a bit like made of cotton

10
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,380
And the skirt is not very orthodox

11
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,790
But I still think it's pretty cute

12
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,030
Then there happened to be another one in Taiwan

13
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,250
A Photo studio of Magician's Chamber

14
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,390
I think it's super cute

15
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,820
I made a special appointment one day and went to take a photograph.

16
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,930
You can appreciate the photos later

17
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,600
Um…

18
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,830
Actually this is my first time

19
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,860
To take a photograph so seriously

20
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,190
Because I really like harry potter

21
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,230
Also I like this series of clothes

22
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,490
And a series about magic

23
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,020
I'm really worried that I can't shoot well

24
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,820
I hope after everyone appreciate

25
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,610
You can give me some criticism and advice of the photos

26
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,970
Before the video starts

27
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,770
I want to tell everyone

28
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,200
Because its material is made by cotton

29
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,010
And

30
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,880
Although I have ironed and cleaned up cat hair.

31
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,200
Because I have three cats

32
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,250
It still has some wrinkled feeling or

33
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,370
Not good enough

34
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,640
Please forgive me and hope everyone can be considerate

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,730
I'm sorry about that

36
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,890
At the beginning

37
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,050
First of all we have to say

38
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,820
Everyone can take a look at my costume

39
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,090
I'm from HufflePuff College

40
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,040
In the beginning

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,280
Because of the movie,

42
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,880
everyone might have been more likely 

43
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,430
in Gryffindor or Slytherin.

44
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,860
At first, I thought I should be in Gryffindor

45
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,750
because

46
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,610
When I was young,I felt that Gryffindor was the best

47
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,930
And Slytherin was the worst

48
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,770
But in the end I felt that I should be

49
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,650
Hufflepuff

50
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:08,920
Because I am not as smart as Ravenclaw

51
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,060
Nor as courageous as Gryffindor

52
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,460
Nor as ambitious as Slytherin

53
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,250
So

54
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,280
I think at least my only strength is kindness

55
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,920
Can I say that?

56
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,010
I don’t think people can be 100% of kind

57
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,450
But I think I should be regarded as a kind-hearted

58
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,780
Witch

59
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,610
Let's take a look at the first set

60
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,160
HufflePuff

61
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,730 is
The first set, the representative yellow of HufflePuff

62
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,460
I bought this cloak at Universal Studios Japan 

63
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,230
I think that it is

64
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,300
Cute

65
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,500
All right

66
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,050
Everyone can look at the bow tie

67
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,600
It's a complete set

68
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,510
And there is the school badge on the chest

69
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,680
There is also a copper badge inside the skirt

70
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,580
And in behind,

71
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,840
there is the sailor collar of HufflePuff 

72
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:17,120
This one is blue

73
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,440
I think it is kind of academic style

74
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,400
It is because Ravenclaw

75
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:23,740
that

76
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,380
I made a very smart feeling.

77
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,140
The feeling of holding a pile of books

78
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,050
I don’t think they made the bow

79
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,500
Very orthodox

80
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,630
But I really like this place around the waist

81
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,230
Look at here.

82
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:51,400
Each piece has a different color in each college

83
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,480
do you know?

84
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,990
When the Sorting Hat was assigning Hermione Jean Granger,

85
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,010
it is hesitating whether she should go to Ravenclaw.

86
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,950
Because she is so smart

87
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,830
It should be said that it is just a personality trait

88
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,890
Maybe there is a person who actually has 4 talents

89
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:19,750
4 ability

90
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,130
Maybe he has it

91
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,060

92
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,460
Finally

93
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,410
It’s a very popular Gryffindor

94
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,640
I tied a ponytail

95
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,290
Looks more vitality

96
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,620
Be vigorous

97
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,000
Then please ignore the hem of my dress

98
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,990
I seem to forget to make it swing

99
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,100
And I don’t know where did I put the bow tie

100
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,930
So I matched a tie by myself

101
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,320
But I think it shouldn’t be matched look so bad

102
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,310
Then this scene

103
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,030
I'm learning from Hermione Jean Granger

104
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:03,830
The scene when she was making the Polyjuice Potion before

105
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,040
Although my appearance is not as good as
Hermione Jean Granger

106
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,010
but

107
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,210
when I'm imitating my idol

108
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,600
I still feel pretty happy

109
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:18,420
Antlers! I wanted to test everyone, which character was called Antlers？

110
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:18,450

111
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,360
At last

112
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,060
I want to apologize to everyone

113
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,450
Sorry.

114
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,600
I don't have Slytherin uniform

115
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:44,100
As I said, I was a person who sees things be black and white

116
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,110
black-and-white thinking

117
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,090
This is my personality

118
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,680
but

119
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,870
I reread the novel a few times after I grow up

120
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,500
Although sometimes in my childhood ...

121
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,290
Ahh...that's another story.

122
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:00,640
When I was young, my family had a strict discipline.

123
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,300
I was kept from computers, mobile phones,

124
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,520
TVs or something like that.

125
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,710
So I read the Harry Potter novels all day

126
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:12,180
From episode 1 to ...  how many episodes have been published at that time?  Episode 5?

127
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,870
I read it from episode 1 to 5.

128
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,480
and I started another round from episode 1 to 5

129
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,040
Then another round.  Again and again.

130
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,710
I used to take a flashlight and read stories of Harry Potter in the quilt.

131
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,200
I felt that I am doing the same thing 

132
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,910
Like Harry Potter hides in the quilt and 

133
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,480
reads the magic books during the holidays.

134
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,230
Oh, wait ! I have to apologize to everyone.

135
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,450
I don't have clothes of Slytherin

136
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,430
But when I grew up, I realized that

137
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:43,030
we aren't black and white in a world.

138
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,010
It's just like

139
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,540
Severus Snape belongs to

140
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,840
Slytherin's

141
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,810
Do you think he is a bad guy？

142
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,200
Is he really a bad guy?

143
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,300
Is he really harmful？

144
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,560
Had he indeed directly kill anyone?

145
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,300
I think 

146
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,170
what he had done actually is that he wanted to integrate with everyone 

147
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,760
integrate with everyone.

148
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,960
He doesn't have his

149
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,730
Own social circle

150
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,320
So

151
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,670
He will

152
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,240
want to take refuge in

153
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,610
the power of Lord Voldemort,

154
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,680
because he wants to make himself stronger.

155
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,860
However I think his innate character is good

156
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,850
Are the people in the Gryffindor really good forever?

157
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,460
You can see that Luna Lovegood had been bullied with her things hidden.

158
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,130
And even

159
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,600
Harry Potter's Dad, James Potter

160
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:35,410
Although both they were fighting

161
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,000
and playing tricks on each other,

162
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,510
Those actions are still some kind of bullying.

163
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,080
So, I started to think about that. Really? Is it like this?

164
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:48,680
In the end I discovered that all the four houses have their own pros and cons.

165
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,100
It doesn't mean that

166
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,300
Only the dark wizard is assigned to Slytherin

167
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,610
Because I recently made this video,

168
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,950
Without Slytherin's uniform.

169
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,790
I think it's a pity .

170
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,510
So

171
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,830
I search the internet about Slytherin's uniform,

172
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:09,620
As I mentioned earlier about the meow shop.

173
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,250
It sold the series of co-branded with Harry Potter again

174
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:11,630
So

175
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,120
I immediately bought Slytherin's uniform

176
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,460
But it may not be seen in this video,

177
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,490
I'm so sorry about that

178
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:22,370
I hope this video could

179
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:23,990
???

180
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,640
Could make you happy when you watch this video

181
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,620
I really like Harry Potter very much

182
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,130
If everyone who likes Harry Potter,

183
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,740
The wizards

184
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,350
want to see me share more about that

185
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,980
I've been to Universal Studios in Japan before.

186
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,370
I went to New York to see that

187
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,780

I recommend a YouTuber who was Frog Knife Saint

00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,680
He did a very detailed analysis of Harry Potter
